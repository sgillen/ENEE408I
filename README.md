This was done for a class, basically the class built a bunch of little roombas with cameras. Each group in the class designed the behavior of their own bot, and they were supposed to come up with something that would allow for some interesting self organized swarm behavior to emerge. 

I wrote some code to do basic following of a tennis ball, or of another robot. I also wrote the tiny webserver the class ended up using to have their robots talk.
